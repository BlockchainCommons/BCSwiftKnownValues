# KnownValues

Registry of Known Values managed by Blockchain Commons.

Known Values are a standardized namespace of 64-bit unsigned integers that represent ontological concepts, potentially across many vocabularies. This standardization aims to enable compact binary representation, interoperability across systems that exchange semantic information, and enhanced security by mitigating the risks associated with URI manipulation.
